# SimpleTradingJournal

Own Your Data....
This was just done as a proof of concept for me to learn C#.
First ever application in C#.  Fully functional as a general jounrnaling application with a few things for traders.
Simple WinForms/SQLite application for Journaling Trades but slowly migrating to WPF-MVVM.
Provides the ability to add multiple screenshots either from file or clipboard to each Journal Entry.
Provides the ability to add HashTags, Instrument traded, and PnL to each Journal Entry though search features are not in place to utilize that data.
Can create Journal entry Templates and those Templates will then be available in the text box dropdown for future journal entries.
Can resize and adjust orientation of the Text/Picture working area which can be helpful for wide screens.
Can hightlight multiple dates in Calendar to show multiple days of Journal entries in the tree view below the calendar.

Color Theme is random and can be changed by clicking on any of the icon in left side menu.
